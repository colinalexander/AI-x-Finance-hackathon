The stock experienced a dramatic surge in early 2024, followed by a sharp decline mid-year, and a partial recovery towards the end of the year.

### Analyst Recommendation

Given the analysis of Micron Technology's stock performance and underlying factors:

- **Recommendation**: **Buy** with cautious optimism.
