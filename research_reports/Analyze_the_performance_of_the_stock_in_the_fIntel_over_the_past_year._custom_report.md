### Performance Ranking of Fintel Plc (LON: FNTL) Stock

1. **Total Shareholder Return (TSR):** Fintel Plc has delivered a strong TSR of 31% over the past year, which is a significant outperformance compared to its five-year annual TSR of 7%. This indicates a robust year for the company in terms of shareholder returns.

2. **Revenue Growth:** The company reported a revenue growth of 10.87% for the half-year ending June 30, 2024, and a year-over-year increase of 4.39% in trailing twelve months revenue. Despite a slight decline in annual revenue for 2023, the recent growth figures suggest a positive trajectory.

3. **Profitability Metrics:** Fintel's profitability shows mixed signals. While the gross profit margin and net profit margin for Q2 2024 are healthy, the significant decline in EPS by 30% over the last twelve months raises concerns about sustained profitability.

4. **Market Comparison:** Fintel's one-year TSR of 31% significantly surpasses the broader market returns, indicating that the stock has performed exceptionally well relative to the market.

5. **Valuation Metrics:** The high P/E ratio of 46.98 suggests that the stock might be overvalued, which could be a concern for potential investors. However, the P/S ratio of 3.96 indicates a moderate valuation relative to sales.

### Analyst Recommendation

**Hold with Cautious Optimism:** Given Fintel Plc's strong TSR performance and positive revenue growth, the stock has demonstrated potential. However, the concerns regarding the significant EPS decline, below-average ROE, and high P/E ratio suggest potential risks. Investors should maintain a cautious approach, closely monitoring the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives. The ongoing strategic acquisitions could provide growth opportunities, but the high valuation and profitability concerns warrant a careful assessment before further investment. Thus, a "Hold" recommendation is advised, with a focus on observing how the company addresses its challenges in the coming periods.
