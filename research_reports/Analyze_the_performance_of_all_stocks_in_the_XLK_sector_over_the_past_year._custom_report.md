Based on the provided context, there is insufficient data to accurately rank the top 25 best-performing and bottom 25 worst-performing stocks within the XLK sector over the past year. The context primarily discusses the overall performance of the XLK ETF and highlights the performance of three major holdings: Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL). Specific percentage returns for individual stocks other than these are not provided, nor is there a comprehensive list of all stocks within the XLK sector with their respective returns.

However, from the limited information available, we can note the following about the mentioned stocks:

1. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**
   - **Performance**: Exceptional growth with a 93.6% year-over-year revenue increase.
   - **Return**: Specific price return not mentioned, but implied to be very positive due to significant revenue growth.

   - **Return**: Specific price return not mentioned, but implied to be positive.

3. **Microsoft (MSFT)**

For a detailed and accurate ranking of the top 25 best and bottom 25 worst-performing stocks within the XLK sector, additional specific data on the annual price returns of each stock in the sector would be required. This data is not provided in the context, and thus a comprehensive ranking cannot be generated from the information available.
