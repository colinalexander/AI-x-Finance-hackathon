## **Motivation**

In quantitative finance, integrating unstructured data into systematic investment strategies remains a key challenge. Hedge funds like DRW, which rely on multi-factor risk models and long/short portfolios, may overlook the alpha opportunities hidden in textual data such as earnings calls, news, and financial reports. AI Trader bridges this gap by providing a platform that extracts actionable insights from unstructured financial data, enabling seamless integration with quantitative models. By enhancing decision-making workflows and uncovering new alpha sources, AI Trader provides a competitive edge in the fast-paced world of finance.
